## 🔄 Event-Driven Architecture

### Message Flow Design

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as Web UI
    participant API as tRPC API
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant MQ as RabbitMQ
    participant N8N as n8n Workflows
    participant EXT as External Services
    
    UI->>API: Create High-Value Customer
    API->>DB: Store Customer Data
    DB-->>API: Customer Created
    API->>MQ: Publish Customer Event
    API-->>UI: Success Response
    
    MQ->>N8N: Route Event to Workflow
    N8N->>EXT: Send Slack Notification
    N8N->>EXT: Send Welcome Email
    EXT-->>N8N: Delivery Confirmation
```

### Event Processing Patterns

**Event Types and Handlers**
```typescript
interface EventTypes {
  'customer.created': {
    customerId: string
    customerValue: 'LOW' | 'MEDIUM' | 'HIGH'
    metadata: CustomerMetadata
  }
  'project.status_changed': {
    projectId: string
    oldStatus: ProjectStatus
    newStatus: ProjectStatus
    timestamp: Date
  }
  'analytics.event': {
    event: string
    userId?: string
    sessionId: string
    metadata: Record<string, any>
  }
}
```

## 🧠 AI Integration Strategy

### OpenAI Implementation

**Prompt Engineering**:
```typescript
const generateInsightPrompt = (customerData: CustomerData) => `
Analyze this customer profile and provide a business insight:

Customer: ${customerData.name}
Company: ${customerData.company}
Value Tier: ${customerData.value}
Projects: ${customerData.projectStats.total} (${customerData.projectStats.completed} completed)
Task Completion Rate: ${customerData.taskStats.completionRate}%

Provide a 2-3 sentence business insight focusing on:
1. Relationship health
2. Growth opportunities
3. Risk factors

Keep the tone professional and actionable.
`;
```

**Fallback Strategy**:
```typescript
const generateFallbackInsight = (customerData: CustomerData): string => {
  const insights = [];
  
  if (customerData.value === 'HIGH') {
    insights.push(`${customerData.name} is a high-value customer with strong engagement.`);
  }
  
  if (customerData.projectStats.overdue > 0) {
    insights.push(`Attention needed: ${customerData.projectStats.overdue} overdue project(s).`);
  }
  
  const completionRate = parseFloat(customerData.taskStats.completionRate);
  if (completionRate > 80) {
    insights.push(`Excellent execution with ${completionRate}% task completion rate.`);
  }
  
  return insights.join(' ');
};
```

## 🔍 Observability Implementation

### Distributed Tracing with OpenTelemetry

**Instrumentation Strategy**:
```typescript
// Auto-instrumentation setup
const sdk = new NodeSDK({
  serviceName: 'lana-ai-service',
  serviceVersion: '1.0.0',
  traceExporter: new JaegerExporter({
    endpoint: 'http://localhost:14268/api/traces',
  }),
  instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()],
});
```

**Custom Spans for Business Logic**:
```typescript
const tracer = trace.getTracer('customer-insights');

export async function generateCustomerInsight(customerId: string) {
  return tracer.startActiveSpan('generate-insight', async (span) => {
    span.setAttributes({
      'customer.id': customerId,
      'service.name': 'ai-service',
    });
    
    try {
      const insight = await processInsight(customerId);
      span.setStatus({ code: SpanStatusCode.OK });
      return insight;
    } catch (error) {
      span.recordException(error);
      span.setStatus({ code: SpanStatusCode.ERROR });
      throw error;
    } finally {
      span.end();
    }
  });
}
```

### Real-time Analytics Implementation

**Event Ingestion Pipeline**:
```typescript
class AnalyticsService {
  async ingestEvent(eventData: AnalyticsEvent) {
    // Store in database for long-term analysis
    const event = await this.prisma.analyticsEvent.create({
      data: eventData
    });
    
    // Update real-time counters in Redis
    const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
    await this.redis.incr(`events:daily:${today}`);
    await this.redis.incr(`events:type:${eventData.event}:${today}`);
    
    return event;
  }
}
```
